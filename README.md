# Meme-Pad
My meme pad soundboard project.

The idea behind this project is to have control of fun interesting media at the tip of your fingers without having expensive hardware.
This currently is a minival viable product and much more can/should be done to flesh it out. 

This repo is just the backend while the frontend for this project is currently a private repo which will go public once I hammer out details on how to run this without a heavy tech background.
The frontend is written to take advantage of an iPad, but is essentially a webpage so can run on any device.

Check back soon for more progress!
